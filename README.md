> One resource per technical topic

There are hundreds and thousands of resources on the internet for each of these technical topics, but only a few of them have a high concentration of valuable content.
<br />
Even more, by analyzing these few resources that have a high concentration of valuable content, we can identify only one resource that contains the most valuable content.
<br />
Here we are applying the Pareto principle, 80% of the result comes from 20% of the effort. In other words, we consume less amount of information and as a result, we gain the desired new knowledge.
<br />
Also, I consider that is very important to start with the right resource when we begin to learn something new.
